Blind and cheap our peoples wander on, 
Mere apes like future and past gone. 

We are long for this world sure,  
Ideals of honour, loyalty and truth lost in Megalopolis. 

Materialism is no new god, but he is braver now.
Mad as Hell Bealeites now distracted. 

Love of music, culture, and freedom hold, 
The freedom to cower, culture fed through copper.

Clones in suits march our streets, 
Who take more than they give.

Noble Lady Civitas surrendering her fruits, 
To neglectful husbands and wives. 

Heroes die young by selling out, 
Villains live to grow old and rich. 

Human nature is the enemy, adapted for the kill,
Urges still rule, greed, fear and and lust. 

So beware the virtuous, trust not the beautiful, 
Stand by your talent, your value, and honour. 

Strike down the crooked, be free from fear and greed, 
And make sure you look good naked before buying expensive clothes.
