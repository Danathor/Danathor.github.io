<ul>
<li> Blind and cheap our peoples wander on, </li>
<li> Mere apes like future and past gone. </li>
<li> We are long for this world sure,  </li>
<li> Ideals of honour, loyalty and truth lost in Megalopolis. </li>

<li>Materialism is no new god, but he is braver now.</li>
<li>Mad as Hell Bealeites now distracted. </li>
<li>Love of music, culture, and freedom hold, </li>
<li>The freedom to cower, culture fed through copper.</li>

<li> Clones in suits march our streets, </li>
<li> Who take more than they give.</li>
<li> Noble Lady Civitas surrendering her fruits, </li>
<li> To neglectful husbands and wives. </li>

<li> Heroes die young by selling out, </li>
<li> Villains live to grow old and rich. </li>
<li> Human nature is the enemy, adapted for the kill, </li>
<li> Urges still rule, greed, fear and lust. </li>

<li> So beware the virtuous, trust not the beautiful, </li>
<li> Stand by your talent, your value, and honour. </li>
<li> Strike down the crooked, be free from fear and greed, </li>
<li> And make sure you look good naked before buying expensive clothes. </li>
